        <p>Noise is the unwanted energy which is generally intervened during the acquisition, transmission, and/or reconstruction of an image. Though the noise cannot be altogether eliminated, however, it can be reduced at acquisition time. It is an inexpensive way  for the appointment booking, doctor refering and image uploading for lab.</p>
        <br><p>In MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), various types of noises can affect image quality and accuracy. One common type is Gaussian Noise, which manifests as random fluctuations following a Gaussian or normal distribution. This noise appears as graininess in the image and can significantly degrade image quality, particularly in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low.</p>
        <br><p>Impulse Noise, also known as Salt-and-Pepper Noise, presents as isolated bright or dark pixels scattered throughout the image. It resembles grains of salt and pepper and can be caused by various factors such as electrical interference or errors in the imaging process. This noise can obscure important details in the image and affect the interpretation of MRI scans, especially in regions with complex tissue structures.</p>
